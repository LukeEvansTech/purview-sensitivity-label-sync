## Compliance Administrator Role

You need the **Compliance Administrator** (or **Compliance Data Administrator**) role in both the source and target tenants. This role grants access to:

- `Get-Label` / `New-Label` / `Set-Label`
- `Get-LabelPolicy` / `New-LabelPolicy` / `Set-LabelPolicy`

The role is assigned in the Microsoft Entra admin center or via PowerShell.

## Network Access

The scripts connect to Security & Compliance PowerShell via `Connect-IPPSSession`. Ensure your network allows outbound connections to Microsoft 365 endpoints.
